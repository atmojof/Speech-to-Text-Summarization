Transcription with Timestamps:/n[00:00]  It's now we don't sell like that. We start selling apartment complexes and/n[00:05]  the wheelers which is exactly behind that wheelers. We can go there and see./n[00:09]  Okay? Okay, okay, let's go./n[00:11]  The road is here. Yes. Over here?/n[00:15]  Here will be the entering to the hotel complex in this road. But this road,/n[00:21]  a little further, we will have the entering exactly to the complex of/n[00:27]  wheelers and the townhouses. Okay./n[00:29]  Here will be located the hotel complex. Yeah, the presentation./n[00:37]  Yeah, we will just show you the presentation at the same time because/n[00:41]  you will exactly see what's going to be located./n[00:46]  Okay./n[00:56]  So, this one did development right? Yeah, this is not about us./n[00:59]  Oh, this is not about us. That's Canadian people wanted to build three wheelers./n[01:03]  Yeah, we tried to negotiate with them about selling this small part./n[01:09]  Yeah, buying this small part. But unfortunately they were disagree with us./n[01:13]  So, we are going to build high fence. Okay./n[01:17]  Okay. Yeah, here we a little bit there. We have the house for future builders./n[01:24]  Yeah, we already installed it. Yeah, here's the territory./n[01:27]  And yes, as just a second./n[01:32]  This is the master plan? Yes. Look, here is exactly will be our complex./n[01:41]  Yeah, the hotel complex. This is free wheelers which are not related to us./n[01:45]  Yes, and Canadian one. Yeah, and Canadian. Yeah, in here a little bit further,/n[01:50]  we will have exactly the townhouses, different cube wheelers and the whole complex itself./n[01:56]  Yeah, we can go there. But the access is pretty far and also the road behind the road./n[02:02]  Here road and there will be the road./n[02:04]  Oh./n[02:04]  Kind actually not because they're only trees and nature there and there are no roads./n[02:13]  So, this one is a leasehold?/n[02:15]  Yeah, this is leasehold in 28 years with prolongation for 25./n[02:24]  This hold for 25./n[02:27]  First leasehold 28 plus 25./n[02:35]  We have already cut a lot of trees because there was like very full territory of mango trees./n[02:41]  But anyway, in our location because it's kind of echo resort, we are going to have a lot of greens./n[02:46]  Because all defenses will be made by nature, by wooden, by trees itself./n[02:52]  And a lot of mango trees are going to be located exactly in our whole territory./n[02:58]  Access will be a dozen meter, what kind of unit the person is going to use./n[03:04]  Like hotel, apartment or villa, they can just walk around the whole complex and use all the things./n[03:09]  Spa centers, co-working centers, gym, yeah, only paying for restaurants./n[03:15]  Yeah, the only thing./n[03:16]  Yeah, the other things will be included./n[03:18]  Yeah, it doesn't matter what kind of unit the person comes to use./n[03:23]  Exactly here./n[03:25]  Before that trees are going to be like, take the here exactly it's going to be a townhouses,/n[03:31]  their townhouses in the center site is going to be swimming pools, children playgrounds./n[03:38]  We also have this in our master plan./n[03:40]  Also walking zones, one interesting and important thing that 50% you know there is a rule/n[03:47]  embodied that only 50% of territory can be built with the houses./n[03:51]  And we exactly follow this rule./n[03:53]  So we have a lot of territory for walk, a lot of territory just to have some entertainment./n[03:59]  Yeah, and only 50% will be busy with exactly the buildings./n[04:03]  Yeah, now we are in the stage of getting a PBG./n[04:07]  Yeah, but we already got another special ID number./n[04:10]  I will just tell you the name to be honest./n[04:16]  Oh, you should let me./n[04:17]  Oh, that's why you name it./n[04:25]  Mango village./n[04:26]  Yeah, mango village exactly./n[04:29]  And you saw there is the Bulgar hotel just five minutes./n[04:32]  Yeah./n[04:32]  So quite premium location and the prices are going to be quite high./n[04:36]  There we will also go a little bit further to Vilos./n[04:39]  Yeah, just one second./n[04:41]  Yeah, and Vilos are also cost, the cost of for night starts from/n[04:45]  $500./n[04:47]  Yeah, we have already got PPCPR, the verification of island use./n[04:53]  Yeah, and now we are in the process to get PBG because it's quite long process./n[04:58]  So about the two or three weeks we are going to get the ID number for PBG/n[05:03]  and we are ready to start the building because before that it's impossible/n[05:06]  according to the rules of Indonesia./n[05:08]  Yeah, that's why we now just cut, get the house for future builders./n[05:16]  Yeah, building houses and very soon in December we are going to start./n[05:21]  And also here we are going to give the prototype of our Vilos because we are/n[05:26]  going to have a special villa./n[05:28]  I don't know, do you know about our concept of 3D printing?/n[05:33]  Yes, yes./n[05:34]  And exactly we are going to put the prototype here to a four like showroom/n[05:39]  and the people can come and see./n[05:40]  Yeah, that's very perfect because people don't know about our/n[05:44]  construction of 3D printing, it's new for Indonesia./n[05:47]  Yeah, it's already built in China, in Japan./n[05:50]  Yeah, but here it's going to be new one so people are very interested/n[05:53]  what it is exactly./n[05:54]  And in the middle of December, yeah, I think before the new year we are going to/n[06:00]  install the prototype./n[06:03]  We will inform you anyway if we have future negotiations, of course we will inform you./n[06:08]  Let's go a little further./n[06:10]  Do you have a local partner or do you just/n[06:15]  do you have a local partner?/n[06:17]  For a non investor, are you 100% foreigner?/n[06:20]  Yeah, we are 100% investor./n[06:23]  Yeah, we have/n[06:31]  Yeah, we have three co-founders./n[06:35]  Yeah, they're in like the people who are working on the building this whole/n[06:40]  complex. They have shareholders./n[06:42]  When shareholders, yeah./n[06:43]  Oh, I'm not a foreigner./n[06:46]  Oh, yes, all foreigner./n[06:48]  Actually, the company is exactly working in the/n[06:52]  Indonesia market more than five years./n[06:54]  Yeah, we were working in the consulting sphere./n[06:58]  We helped different constructors for marketing and sales before./n[07:04]  What consulting?/n[07:07]  Form of consulting./n[07:10]  Yeah, it was the marketing sales./n[07:12]  It was just the sales./n[07:13]  It was the helping in the project, the whole, in the construction, the development,/n[07:20]  construction, helping in the project because we worked with/n[07:25]  foreigner companies like Utopia LAP, which is exactly the architecture company./n[07:30]  Yes, and they helped to construct the whole thing./n[07:34]  Yeah, here, can you show?/n[07:37]  So, exactly in this place here is going to be like/n[07:41]  it is our/n[07:47]  up-part complex./n[07:58]  This one?/n[08:00]  Yeah, you know, this one./n[08:02]  But we have a closer master plan./n[08:07]  Yeah, here, we turned left./n[08:11]  And exactly here, yes, it's going to be like it./n[08:14]  Now we're a part complex./n[08:16]  It's four floors and a rooftop./n[08:20]  Four floors for apartments and a rooftop./n[08:23]  Yeah, no more than 15 meters, according to the legislation./n[08:26]  Yeah, so about this thing, everything is correct./n[08:29]  Yeah, and then.../n[08:31]  This one is stage two./n[08:33]  It's a stage two./n[08:34]  Exactly./n[08:35]  Now we are in presale of stage one./n[08:37]  Stage one here./n[08:38]  Yes, stage one is there in the center./n[08:41]  Okay, okay./n[08:42]  Yeah./n[08:43]  What is it?/n[08:44]  This is swimming pools./n[08:46]  Oh, also./n[08:48]  We have swimming pools for everybody./n[08:51]  Even wheelers have, even townhouses have/n[08:53]  their own swimming pools./n[08:55]  But it's no problem to use./n[08:57]  So where's the villa?/n[08:58]  The villa is here and there's a residential here./n[09:02]  Yeah./n[09:03]  You mean like we now are standing here, like exactly here./n[09:08]  We are standing and looking and now we're a part complex/n[09:10]  which is going to be located here./n[09:13]  Yeah./n[09:14]  Also here./n[09:18]  Yeah, apartments in apartment complex have ocean views./n[09:22]  Four floors./n[09:23]  Four floors and the rooftop of the floors,/n[09:25]  we have the ocean view exactly there./n[09:27]  Yeah, we can go to the cliff because it's only 100 meters from here./n[09:31]  And see the view because it's the highest cliff in Olovatto./n[09:34]  In Olovatto./n[09:35]  Yeah, we can go./n[09:38]  And we also, there is a pass to the ocean./n[09:43]  But unfortunately the condition is not good./n[09:46]  And we are thinking about a negotiation with the government/n[09:50]  to, for collaboration to re-review this one./n[09:53]  Re-new like it./n[09:54]  Make it comfortable for people to go down to the ocean./n[09:58]  Because the condition is really not bad and it's a little/n[10:01]  dangerous now./n[10:02]  Yeah, but I will show you./n[10:04]  I'll show you just a little./n[10:05]  Ah, yeah./n[10:06]  We are going to have bus, shuttle bus to the beach./n[10:11]  Yeah, most likely it's going to be Nyankian because it's/n[10:14]  five, seven minutes from here./n[10:16]  Yeah, very close./n[10:18]  So the design is like trekking on?/n[10:20]  Yes, it's exactly our Instagram card./n[10:23]  Yes, we'll just, this is one of our units,/n[10:28]  which is called a natural./n[10:31]  Yeah, in the second./n[10:32]  It's a dizzling hole./n[10:33]  Yeah, if you open the second screen, exactly the second in/n[10:36]  the presentation, if I'm not mistaken, it's going to be exactly,/n[10:41]  ah, I can show you./n[10:43]  It's difficult by phone, but it's this one, right?/n[10:46]  This one?/n[10:47]  Yeah, it's exactly this kind of prototype./n[10:49]  We are going to install here./n[10:51]  Oh, the triangle one./n[10:53]  Yeah, because only 3D printing contraction is like,/n[10:57]  it's possible to do this only with unusual form of building./n[11:01]  In traditional form, it's almost impossible or very expensive to construct/n[11:05]  something similar./n[11:06]  That's why we have like this new feature/n[11:10]  in exactly the structure./n[11:11]  So we use BIM./n[11:14]  We use?/n[11:15]  Yeah, BIM./n[11:17]  BIM, BIM./n[11:18]  What is it?/n[11:19]  Um, we have a building./n[11:21]  Building what?/n[11:23]  Yeah, information management?/n[11:25]  Building information management./n[11:27]  Yes, we are working with,/n[11:31]  Chinese company, which has, yeah,/n[11:34]  our company, big by the group, we have subcompany,/n[11:37]  which is called Legends 3D./n[11:39]  Legends 3D, it's the only company in Indonesia,/n[11:43]  which can deliver 3D printers from China to here./n[11:48]  And we have like special right to use it./n[11:51]  For now, only Legends 3D,/n[11:53]  Legends 3D, it's our subcompany./n[11:55]  Yeah, initially company was,/n[11:59]  the company, the whole biggest headquarter is in China./n[12:02]  Yes, and yesterday we had negotiation,/n[12:07]  Chinese representative came to our office in Kuta./n[12:10]  Yeah, and we had two hours meetings./n[12:12]  We talked about the advantages or maybe disadvantages/n[12:16]  of the 3D printing./n[12:18]  He gave us all the certification of standards./n[12:21]  He explained us all the information about 3D printing,/n[12:25]  that this is quite fast way that is used in Dubai./n[12:28]  Maybe you know the office of the future./n[12:31]  Absolutely./n[12:32]  Yeah, it's in Dubai, yes, office of the future./n[12:34]  Exactly was built in the usage of 3D printing./n[12:39]  And I will show you also,/n[12:44]  I tell you, it's a 3D,/n[12:46]  Autopaylap is our Hitekler company,/n[12:48]  which, architect, the design, but 3D,/n[12:51]  Legends 3D is exactly as builder./n[12:55]  As a builder, yeah./n[13:13]  Nice view./n[13:15]  Yeah, it's not going to be a little close./n[13:18]  And the temples here,/n[13:20]  exactly, and there's kind of tourists,/n[13:23]  which is like, if it's very sunny,/n[13:26]  but we also have a plan to make it a little wider,/n[13:31]  and have a little fence in the cliff./n[13:33]  Because it's very nice view here, you will just see./n[13:36]  And it's very good for tourists, just to come and look at that./n[13:47]  Yeah./n[14:13]  For example, we can see it's both here./n[14:16]  It's the first./n[14:20]  It's just a view of what?/n[14:22]  We can go a little bit further here,/n[14:24]  and we will see much more interesting view./n[14:28]  Yeah./n[14:44]  Very sunny./n[14:46]  Yeah./n[14:48]  Oh./n[14:50]  Where is that?/n[14:52]  Yeah, it's over there, a little bit there./n[14:57]  The young age there?/n[14:58]  Yeah./n[15:00]  But again, in the left side, we have the pass,/n[15:04]  but it's dangerous now./n[15:06]  More pure, it's behind this villa./n[15:10]  That one is Bulgaria, right?/n[15:12]  Bulgaria?/n[15:14]  Yes, they have villas there./n[15:16]  They have villas, but hotel complex is a little bit in front of us./n[15:27]  Yeah./n[15:29]  So what is your plan here?/n[15:31]  Uh, plan here is just to make it as a view platform./n[15:35]  Nothing special, maybe it's going to be the fence,/n[15:37]  because it can be dangerous for children, for example./n[15:41]  Yeah, they only think./n[15:43]  So, is it still your land?/n[15:45]  No, this is not a land./n[15:47]  That's why we are in negotiation process/n[15:51]  this government for collaboration./n[15:53]  Because we cannot do this by ourselves./n[15:56]  It's prohibited by law./n[15:58]  We cannot use the government's lands without permission./n[16:02]  And because this place doesn't belong to anybody,/n[16:08]  any company, any business, so it's governmental one./n[16:12]  Uh-huh./n[16:14]  But this?/n[16:15]  What?/n[16:16]  This is the temple, as we know./n[16:18]  But.../n[16:21]  All the time when we come here?/n[16:23]  No./n[16:24]  No vibe is there./n[16:25]  You think that this is the temple, because there is a temple out there./n[16:28]  Oh, the temple?/n[16:30]  But all the time we come here, nobody is there./n[16:33]  Oh, okay./n[16:35]  Yes./n[16:37]  And this one is?/n[16:39]  And this one is the villas./n[16:41]  Yes./n[16:43]  Kajangan?/n[16:45]  Yes, they are also premium./n[16:47]  Piles?/n[16:49]  When we go back, we can see the names of Piles./n[16:53]  Yeah, the night starts from $5 or $600./n[16:59]  So, as an investor, do you think this location is good?/n[17:05]  Yes./n[17:07]  Is this the one that gets you a certain four or something like that?/n[17:15]  Absolutely, because this is quite far, you know, from this car's bike's past life./n[17:22]  And a lot of people want to come for family relaxing, for example, or just be around the nature./n[17:28]  And here it's very quiet./n[17:30]  And all the people who come to this village or to Bogor is they exactly search for something like this./n[17:34]  And we are exactly between them./n[17:36]  You see, it's very quiet./n[17:38]  There are no cars here./n[17:40]  Absolutely./n[17:42]  Nobody is driving./n[17:44]  There are no facilities around here./n[17:47]  I mean, if you want to go in the car, you have to go like.../n[17:53]  You know, we thought about that./n[17:56]  First of all, we have very big infrastructure in our complex./n[17:59]  They are going to be commercial./n[18:01]  Properties like in the hotel complex, it's going to be the stores that everything the tourists need to buy./n[18:07]  Also, the spa centers./n[18:09]  We have free restaurants./n[18:11]  We have free ground, a lot of swimming pools opened and closed swimming pools./n[18:16]  But if the person, anyway, wants to go to see something, it's only 10 minutes by by here./n[18:21]  And there are stores and everything here./n[18:24]  And also, a book keep is very loaded with a lot of beach clubs./n[18:31]  For example, Milaistits is not so far from the LSD./n[18:35]  Yes./n[18:37]  A lot of premium complexes are located in the book keep 6 senses./n[18:42]  The age./n[18:44]  So, Savaya Beach Club here./n[18:47]  That's why, of course, we are sure that we will have the people who really want to go for this kind of conversation./n[18:55]  Okay, go to the right./n[18:57]  Here you are./n[18:59]  You are so great./n[19:01]  How many villas do you live there?/n[19:03]  Sorry, first stage./n[19:05]  How many villas?/n[19:06]  How many villas in the first stage?/n[19:08]  26./n[19:10]  26./n[19:12]  You have already told how many?/n[19:14]  We have the.../n[19:18]  Oh, sorry, I forgot this word in English./n[19:22]  So, the person made the prepayment./n[19:26]  Free./n[19:28]  Yes, free objects./n[19:30]  Now we have the very big negotiation with one potential customer,/n[19:34]  who is exactly a architecture./n[19:36]  And he is the person who wants to know all the kinds of construction, what is happening, what kind of concrete is using./n[19:46]  Yeah, yeah./n[19:48]  But our concrete is the fact is three times higher standards that Indonesia gives./n[19:54]  Yesterday we in the collaboration with Chinese person from Lidgenstreetin,/n[20:00]  the company here exactly gave us the list of standards of Indonesia./n[20:06]  Yeah, and we used higher standards than it can be./n[20:10]  It is talking about the earthquake sustainable, yes, because we know./n[20:14]  Because this kind of construction is used in Japan./n[20:17]  And in Japan it is a very big problem./n[20:20]  Yeah./n[20:22]  And how about the water here?/n[20:24]  The water here?/n[20:26]  What are the conditions?/n[20:28]  There are three versions of the water./n[20:30]  Okay, they are sorry me, but I don't remember this word./n[20:34]  They are three, you know, like the big holes with 150 meters deeper./n[20:40]  Oh, you dig, you dig the hole./n[20:42]  Yeah, we dig 150 meters of three holes./n[20:46]  And what are the whole complex?/n[20:48]  For the whole complex./n[20:50]  Oh, for the whole complex./n[20:52]  Three stages./n[20:54]  So the water is not an issue?/n[20:56]  Yeah, we talked about the whole thing that the person needs every day, of course./n[21:02]  That's the first thing that we talked about./n[21:04]  We solved this./n[21:06]  That's not a problem here because Bulgaria did the same situation./n[21:10]  This kind of thing./n[21:12]  When the development started?/n[21:16]  Exactly in December when we get the number of PJ./n[21:24]  It's okay./n[21:26]  That's okay./n[21:28]  PBG./n[21:30]  PBG./n[21:32]  The number of PBG./n[21:34]  We already have 3D printer in Nuanu./n[21:40]  Now it's printing architectural design or things./n[21:44]  The developer is the same with the Nuanu?/n[21:48]  No, it's just 3D printing./n[21:50]  Now it's like the location of our 3D printer./n[21:54]  Now it's in Nuanu./n[21:56]  Yes, as I know, our 3D printing is also creating the architectural statue or something for Nuanu./n[22:04]  We are going to transfer it here to print the prototype that we're talking about./n[22:10]  The triangle one./n[22:12]  Yeah./n[22:14]  You know, as I know, that's close information./n[22:18]  Because it's kind of new thing./n[22:22]  But we can make the photo./n[22:24]  But we can eye./n[22:26]  Yes, we have the photo and drone videos for you./n[22:30]  On Friday, we print the photo directly./n[22:34]  You know, we can ask if it's possible to give this information we would like to share./n[22:38]  But we are absolutely going to share with you with the videos of printing./n[22:44]  What is happening?/n[22:46]  Yes./n[22:48]  Generally, we can send you the information about 3D printers, how it works and why it's a very good decision now./n[23:04]  All right./n[23:06]  You can just told me that it's possible to see the Nuanu object after the end of that./n[23:12]  Because even employees who are working in Nuanu, they have special license to come and see./n[23:18]  Oh./n[23:20]  Yeah, it's like closed information./n[23:22]  I don't know, because maybe if it's everybody can come and see, that's not a surprise attack./n[23:26]  Oh, okay./n[23:28]  So, do you have any hospitality management?/n[23:34]  Yeah, first-site management./n[23:36]  No, I mean, if we buy some filler and we want to know who are the operator like that./n[23:46]  It's first-site management./n[23:48]  It's our management company./n[23:50]  On your own, on the site management./n[23:52]  Yeah, it's our company./n[23:55]  It's a company which is just working in the valley for more than 14 years./n[23:59]  It's one of the top companies, I think you may be know./n[24:02]  It's our first-site management./n[24:06]  First-site management./n[24:08]  Yeah, also the.../n[24:10]  I need a presentation./n[24:14]  I do not know./n[24:16]  Hi, bye./n[24:22]  I can a little bit explain about the first-site management./n[24:26]  In the hardware market, in the Indonesian market./n[24:28]  Now it's working./n[24:30]  It's working for more than 14 years./n[24:32]  And under the management, they have more than 500 objects./n[24:38]  Yeah, unfortunately, they have this.../n[24:40]  Hello./n[24:42]  This is our friend./n[24:44]  Yeah./n[24:48]  They have.../n[24:50]  This company is collaborating with IRB&D./n[24:52]  Oh, and.../n[24:54]  The marketing is on IRB&D./n[24:56]  Absolutely./n[24:58]  They need to do everything./n[25:00]  And the whole complex will be also served by the first-site management too./n[25:04]  And how many percent if the investor are the Apple?/n[25:08]  How many percent out of the whole?/n[25:12]  It's more than about 50-50-1./n[25:16]  Yeah, 50-1.50./n[25:18]  So the management is included./n[25:20]  OTA, like the usage of booking and Airbnb is also included because they pay money for that./n[25:30]  Yes, also there is 1 percent taken for future maybe re-innovation if something happens./n[25:38]  But we give guarantee 10 years for construction./n[25:40]  It's quite big right./n[25:42]  Yeah, 50-50./n[25:44]  Yeah, you know, it doesn't matter what kind of percent they take./n[25:48]  The most important fact is how much the investor finally gets./n[25:52]  Yeah, the prices here are not so low because of the location, because of the border and like that./n[25:58]  Oh./n[26:00]  Yeah, there's a lot more here./n[26:02]  I.../n[26:04]  There are RY stars from 15 percent, according to the.../n[26:08]  ...parcite because of the parasite./n[26:10]  Because they work a lot of years in this market./n[26:12]  Yes, they have their database and they know when the flow of tourists come./n[26:18]  So they collaborate the prices in the season when.../n[26:22]  In the season, exactly when it's season here in Bali./n[26:26]  Yes, so that's why because of their even experience, it's easy to rely on them./n[26:32]  Yes, RY starts from 15 percent./n[26:34]  It depends, of course, on the union./n[26:36]  Yeah./n[26:38]  So for pre-sale price to get all the money back for 5 and 6 years, because pre-sale price is much lower than the stage 1./n[26:46]  It's going to be the stage 1./n[26:48]  Because we are considered as the premium segment./n[26:52]  So the prices are not going to be so low, but in the comparison with the Bulgari, for example, where the wheel is here, we are anyway our price are much more affordable./n[27:02]  But at the same time, the quality./n[27:04]  And the unusual construction is here./n[27:06]  Yes, that's why./n[27:08]  I heard 10 years in the Vara Garen./n[27:12]  Yes, because it's a very big, high Chinese company which already made a lot of 3D printing objects in around the world./n[27:22]  They are also working in the USA market./n[27:24]  But the USA have very high standards./n[27:27]  Japan market, because first week we can understand that it's sustainable./n[27:31]  Yes, so that's why they give the guarantee of that./n[27:34]  And we as a developer give the guarantee also for 10 years it's in our agreement./n[27:40]  Yes./n[27:41]  And the one year guarantee for any furniture like all included, I mean if something happens in the first year, was it table for example, or visit TV?/n[27:49]  It's also there is the guarantee./n[27:51]  Full stock guarantee./n[27:52]  For construction 10 years./n[27:55]  Also./n[27:57]  Yes, actually./n[28:02]  This is the biggest buyer here./n[28:05]  Sorry./n[28:06]  The biggest buyer?/n[28:07]  The biggest buyer./n[28:08]  Yes, the very notice./n[28:10]  The very notice./n[28:11]  The owner, he wants to buy two bedrooms apartment with the ocean view./n[28:15]  The price is more than $250,000./n[28:20]  But it's around 80 square meters./n[28:23]  Our apartment starts with 48 and the health square meters, one bedroom apartment./n[28:28]  That's important because if we go to Chimgur, for example, all the apartments, like one bedroom apartment, start with 22 square meters, which is very short./n[28:37]  But because we are like the premium segment, we decided to make exactly the peak of our units./n[28:43]  So all our units, no of our units are small./n[28:47]  That's like a thing./n[28:49]  No, we have one bedroom and two bedrooms./n[28:53]  And of course, we have one bedroom, two floors, we have two bedrooms, and roof top./n[29:00]  We have around five types of units in the first and second station, not about the hotel./n[29:09]  The hotel is still in the construction./n[29:12]  In the first hotel, we have like a villa and a bedroom apartment./n[29:18]  Yeah, four levels./n[29:23]  The hotel will be maybe, yeah, because we cannot build more than 15 meters according to the station./n[29:30]  Yeah, maybe it's going to be five, because it's possible./n[29:36]  Because the defense actually now, the other project managers, they are working on this project,/n[29:44]  it's going to be come for information after the new year./n[29:48]  Yeah, now exactly we are talking about the first and second stage./n[29:52]  It's real estate apartments./n[29:56]  One bedroom, right?/n[29:58]  Right starts with 134,000./n[30:03]  Yeah, it's exactly the smallest, let's say, the smallest, but it's 48 in the house square meters./n[30:11]  Yeah, 48./n[30:13]  Yes, with a pool./n[30:15]  You know, we have, for apartment complex, we have their oven pool in the territory./n[30:20]  Only villa has their ovens./n[30:22]  For the one bedroom villa, I mean./n[30:24]  For one bedroom villa, yes, every villa that we have, have their ovens too much./n[30:30]  With one bedroom villa, it's exactly natural./n[30:35]  This triangle villa that we just showed, it's about to start with 215,000 interstates./n[30:41]  Or including tax./n[30:44]  Yes, including the tax./n[30:45]  Everything is included./n[30:46]  Only maybe the.../n[30:48]  No tax./n[30:49]  Yeah, not very.../n[30:50]  Not very.../n[30:52]  Not a repeat, but it's usually 1%, we take help of that for us./n[30:58]  So the investor needs to pay only help percent./n[31:01]  That's all./n[31:02]  All the other things are included./n[31:04]  215,000./n[31:06]  215,000./n[31:07]  215,000, but you.../n[31:09]  We pay health debt./n[31:10]  And we.../n[31:11]  Yes./n[31:12]  And the investor pays health./n[31:13]  The other.../n[31:14]  All the taxes, the others there, included already in the price./n[31:17]  The old taxes are included./n[31:19]  So what's the payment term for the one bedroom villa?/n[31:22]  Payment term?/n[31:23]  I mean, we have 30%, 30%./n[31:27]  30% it's the first./n[31:29]  The payment and then.../n[31:32]  We have.../n[31:33]  I will just.../n[31:35]  I'll tell you./n[31:36]  About that, do you think?/n[31:37]  Yeah./n[31:38]  And then it's possible to pay like every month or every three months before the.../n[31:44]  We finish the full construction and give to exploitation./n[31:47]  It's going to be in September, 2026./n[31:50]  Vorks will finish in April, but actually because of the documents for giving to the.../n[31:55]  Usage of that, we take a little less than health here./n[31:59]  Yes./n[32:00]  Around 20 years./n[32:02]  Around 20 years./n[32:03]  Around 20 years, yeah./n[32:04]  20 years, yeah./n[32:05]  So the balance is 70%./n[32:07]  It is spread over.../n[32:09]  20 years./n[32:10]  Yes./n[32:11]  Not even 70%, 50%./n[32:14]  You can split and finally when we give exactly the keys, they can pay 10./n[32:20]  And we give 10 for instalment for 12 years that we can.../n[32:24]  Investor can pay with the income./n[32:27]  Oh, okay./n[32:28]  Yeah./n[32:29]  It's very interesting, yeah, that's why we talked about./n[32:31]  It's very possible./n[32:32]  Of course if investor wants to pay the full or doesn't want to take instalment after giving to usage, no problem./n[32:38]  Okay./n[32:39]  So the one that do Vila, 215 thousand US dollars./n[32:42]  Yes./n[32:43]  How big is that, meaning in terms of spare meter?/n[32:46]  40, nice./n[32:47]  40 meter./n[32:48]  40 meter./n[32:49]  40 meter./n[32:50]  It's exactly the first floor./n[32:51]  But we have every meal has a big territory, about 190 square meters./n[32:57]  T-RS included a rooftop./n[33:02]  Think rooftop included and.../n[33:06]  In the 100 is the land size./n[33:09]  Yes./n[33:10]  I can show you./n[33:11]  I can show you./n[33:12]  Just sorry but we couldn't find our English presentation./n[33:18]  Yeah, it's easy to find but you have to send it./n[33:22]  Wow./n[33:23]  This is triangle, yeah./n[33:26]  Can I please.../n[33:29]  That's one bit./n[33:31]  Yeah, this is exactly the.../n[33:34]  Yeah, here you can see that the plot area, it's almost 200 meters./n[33:40]  And the unit is 111 because we include T-RS and the rooftop exactly Vila's area./n[33:46]  As swimming pool is not included, but anyway we have swimming pooled with meters./n[33:50]  So actually it's not small, absolutely./n[33:54]  Yeah./n[33:55]  A little below we have other information./n[34:01]  Yes, it's.../n[34:03]  Can I please show you this one?/n[34:05]  3D printing is exactly a print like that./n[34:08]  And we are going to save this kind of fall because it's a unique one./n[34:11]  We're just going to paint it of course./n[34:14]  Yeah, but the person can see exactly what it is./n[34:17]  Yeah./n[34:18]  This one did./n[34:19]  This is one.../n[34:20]  Yeah, one bedroom with rooftop./n[34:22]  Yeah./n[34:23]  Yeah./n[34:24]  T-RS here, big territory and just the green fence around because we are eco-reserved./n[34:29]  That's our visit card./n[34:34]  Yeah./n[34:35]  150?/n[34:36]  Yes./n[34:37]  In the pre-sale of course, because we are planning to sell it after the giving to usage maybe/n[34:46]  we will be able to sell it for at least 30% more./n[34:49]  The price will be at least 30% more but can be higher./n[34:52]  So how much do we demand for that?/n[34:55]  Demons?/n[34:56]  It's down payment, I think it's present around 60,000 years./n[35:00]  Ah./n[35:01]  Yeah./n[35:02]  And we want to split it./n[35:04]  What happened in 2000?/n[35:06]  We need to buy it./n[35:08]  We need to buy one./n[35:10]  And we make it here./n[35:13]  Yeah./n[35:14]  We actually have the full financial model./n[35:16]  Yes, exactly./n[35:17]  The detailed financial model./n[35:19]  Yeah, that's exactly the case./n[35:21]  About 8,000 years?/n[35:23]  Yeah./n[35:24]  For 24 months./n[35:26]  For 24 months./n[35:27]  It's a little less than 24 but yes, around 3,000 years./n[35:32]  Thank you./n[35:34]  So what's the.../n[35:36]  For example, if I put my money down, what's the risk?/n[35:41]  There are no risks because we paid for 50% of the whole length/n[35:47]  and we pay installment in times./n[35:50]  So we have the installment that's normal situation, absolutely./n[35:53]  And this is almost our length and also,/n[35:55]  the kind our territory, which is 1.2 hectares,/n[35:58]  the kind where you see the trees./n[36:00]  We are also going to buy and we are in the negotiation process/n[36:04]  to why our projects and make their fifth and sixth stage/n[36:08]  because there is also 1.2 hectares or free territory./n[36:14]  And our shareholders are in the negotiation process of buying this one./n[36:19]  The only problem?/n[36:21]  That's not actually a problem but the Canadian guys couldn't agree with Canadian people/n[36:26]  because they wanted to build their real estate here./n[36:29]  This is different./n[36:31]  This is different./n[36:32]  Yes./n[36:33]  Our.../n[36:34]  Your plant is well there./n[36:36]  Yeah, we are going to be standing here and there./n[36:39]  There are not like that./n[36:41]  Yeah, exactly. Behind them we also have territory./n[36:43]  Like this plant./n[36:44]  Oh, there are around here./n[36:46]  Yes, a little around./n[36:48]  But this one./n[36:50]  This one is here./n[36:53]  The one, the Canadian here./n[36:55]  Oh, that one./n[36:56]  They are trying to add the territory and the one./n[36:59]  Oh, there's a blank screen./n[37:01]  Oh, you go on onto that side./n[37:03]  Yes, yes, there./n[37:04]  We have a row here, here, there./n[37:06]  This is the hotel here./n[37:08]  This is the hotel here./n[37:10]  But it's here./n[37:11]  The economy here./n[37:13]  The triangle one is here./n[37:15]  If it's just in case, the developer cannot be the winner./n[37:18]  What's the request of the developer?/n[37:21]  If the developer cannot be the winner./n[37:24]  This is why I asked you before, what is your prior project?/n[37:31]  Because we want to secure our infrastructure./n[37:34]  If we turn, you know your track record./n[37:38]  Yeah, track record./n[37:40]  And for us, there is a risk./n[37:43]  Because if the developer cannot be the winner./n[37:46]  Oh, yeah./n[37:47]  Okay, cannot deliver./n[37:48]  You mean the 3D printers?/n[37:49]  No, no, no./n[37:50]  The project is not finished./n[37:52]  Okay, back up./n[37:54]  But if the.../n[37:56]  If the system is not finished,/n[37:59]  there is a risk./n[38:00]  Okay, it's done./n[38:01]  Yes./n[38:02]  And we have a risk./n[38:04]  It's not finished yet?/n[38:05]  Yes./n[38:06]  Compact./n[38:07]  Yes./n[38:08]  And.../n[38:09]  You have to be in the middle./n[38:12]  As I told, actually, we have three shareholders./n[38:17]  The three, why big shareholders?/n[38:19]  And the company is in the Asian market,/n[38:21]  it's more than five years./n[38:23]  That's why the shareholders are exactly.../n[38:26]  They are free of them because they can support each other in the way of that./n[38:30]  There is.../n[38:31]  You know, I think that's almost impossible to give 100% guarantee./n[38:35]  Because the only thing that we can give you,/n[38:38]  it's the maybe bank account to see that we have money./n[38:41]  But it's information that nobody can give you./n[38:44]  That's why./n[38:45]  Yeah, but.../n[38:46]  Is it possible for us to take your office in Kutam?/n[38:49]  Absolutely./n[38:50]  If we can see our office at this weekend./n[38:52]  Absolutely./n[38:53]  Yeah, we would like to invite you./n[38:55]  Yes, that's.../n[38:56]  In Kutam./n[38:57]  Very good./n[38:58]  In Kutam, near Sanctuary, you know.../n[39:01]  Very close to Sanctuary./n[39:03]  Yeah, we can send you the address./n[39:06]  We can agree maybe even today or maybe tomorrow in the morning as much comfortable for you./n[39:11]  We have quite big office./n[39:13]  The first site management, which is our management company,/n[39:15]  is exactly.../n[39:16]  ...make rents, the office./n[39:19]  In this one, the site management is in the village./n[39:22]  The village in Indonesia market is more than 14 years./n[39:25]  So it's also very reliable./n[39:27]  Yes, you can easily come to see speak with our heads, with our directors./n[39:32]  Yeah, so that's very easy./n[39:35]  Yes, yes./n[39:36]  And we'll invest./n[39:37]  We'll let the person only one./n[39:38]  Maybe./n[39:39]  Oh, no, no, no./n[39:40]  You can come./n[39:41]  We can give you all the documents./n[39:43]  I have nothing in your.../n[39:45]  Yeah, as I told you./n[39:47]  As I told you./n[39:49]  Yeah, it's impossible to start building because we need to get all the documents./n[39:55]  And we are in the process./n[39:56]  Yes./n[39:57]  And.../n[39:58]  You know, no./n[39:59]  There is no problems here because we have already got PPPKPR./n[40:03]  You have verification of land./n[40:05]  Yes, because we bought this land for more than 50% now./n[40:09]  Yes, and there is a process of giving PBG is a little.../n[40:13]  ...not fast./n[40:15]  Yeah, but we are ready to get our ID PBG number, which gives us opportunity to start building./n[40:22]  And it's going to be exactly in two, three weeks./n[40:24]  So we are talking about the prototype, which we're going to install here./n[40:28]  Of this triangle wheeler./n[40:30]  Yes./n[40:31]  It's going to be installed in the middle of December./n[40:34]  Yes./n[40:35]  Somewhere there./n[40:36]  So I guess it's going to be somewhere there./n[40:38]  Yeah./n[40:39]  Just showroom./n[40:40]  Showroom./n[40:41]  Yeah./n[40:42]  And we are going to build it by December./n[40:44]  Oh, a prototype./n[40:46]  A prototype./n[40:47]  Pretty cool./n[40:48]  Pretty cool./n[40:49]  So fast way./n[40:50]  Yes./n[40:51]  Labor./n[40:52]  Yeah./n[40:53]  One of the very good things./n[40:54]  Labor work is excluded here./n[40:56]  So if the person is tired, if the person doesn't have enough quality to build,/n[41:01]  yeah, doesn't matter because the machine with the usage of artificial intelligence knows what to do./n[41:07]  And our concrete is very high quality./n[41:12]  We also have the document of standards./n[41:14]  It's much more higher than in the nation market, ask us for./n[41:18]  Yes./n[41:19]  So if you put very bad quality of cement, for example, and sand into our machine,/n[41:26]  it will just not print./n[41:27]  So when can we visit it?/n[41:29]  We will inform you, of course./n[41:31]  We will inform you./n[41:32]  We always inform on that./n[41:33]  It takes months./n[41:34]  Yeah./n[41:35]  Exactly./n[41:36]  Our director said that it's going to be around the middle of December./n[41:40]  Yeah./n[41:41]  Around the middle of December./n[41:42]  Yeah./n[41:43]  That's good./n[41:44]  The contractor is from China./n[41:46]  The contractor, yeah, we have three contractors./n[41:51]  Two from China./n[41:52]  One, it's a French architecture company, which is going to construct our hotel complex./n[41:57]  It's a Nautilus./n[41:59]  Maybe you know, they created Hilton./n[42:01]  And one more./n[42:04]  Meridian./n[42:05]  Yeah, Meridian./n[42:06]  So the name of this complex is Mango./n[42:11]  Yes./n[42:12]  Our company./n[42:13]  It's all mangoes./n[42:14]  Mangoes./n[42:15]  You're free of mangoes./n[42:17]  We are going to have a lot of greens./n[42:20]  Really a lot of greens./n[42:22]  Echoes./n[42:23]  And even our construction doesn't have a lot of waste because we're printing./n[42:28]  Oh, yeah./n[42:29]  Well, that's not only looking that we have the green stuff./n[42:33]  It's exactly the construction is echo./n[42:35]  That's the thing./n[42:36]  That's 3D printer./n[42:40]  Ah, there is one thing./n[42:42]  3D printer can be located in any places./n[42:45]  But also 3D printing is going to print outside of this place./n[42:51]  And some parts, they are delivered here and they can track it./n[42:55]  Like mix it./n[42:56]  Yeah, together./n[42:57]  We have videos of that./n[42:58]  To be honest, because some people think how is it possible to deliver./n[43:02]  Maybe it's going to break while delivering./n[43:04]  No, we have all the videos how it works./n[43:07]  So we will send you today, I think./n[43:10]  Because only yesterday we had negotiations with Chinese partner./n[43:15]  He came to our office./n[43:16]  So he didn't send us all the information, only some presentations./n[43:20]  And we will ask him to send the videos that he showed us./n[43:23]  And we will send it to you./n[43:25]  But if you can build it pretty, how come it takes 20 months?/n[43:29]  Yes, that's a usual question./n[43:32]  Because this is anyway the first thing in Bali with the 3D printing./n[43:37]  We take just a little time in advance, just for hours to guarantee ourselves./n[43:43]  Of course it's possible to make it faster./n[43:46]  But we don't want to say that we are going to finish our building here./n[43:51]  And then investor will be
