 It's now we don't sell like that. We start selling apartment complexes and the wheelers which is exactly behind that wheelers. We can go there and see. Okay? Okay, okay, let's go. The road is here. Yes. Over here? Here will be the entering to the hotel complex in this road. But this road, a little further, we will have the entering exactly to the complex of wheelers and the townhouses. Okay. Here will be located the hotel complex. Yeah, the presentation. Yeah, we will just show you the presentation at the same time because you will exactly see what's going to be located. Okay. So, this one did development right? Yeah, this is not about us. Oh, this is not about us. That's Canadian people wanted to build three wheelers. Yeah, we tried to negotiate with them about selling this small part. Yeah, buying this small part. But unfortunately they were disagree with us. So, we are going to build high fence. Okay. Okay. Yeah, here we a little bit there. We have the house for future builders. Yeah, we already installed it. Yeah, here's the territory. And yes, as just a second. This is the master plan? Yes. Look, here is exactly will be our complex. Yeah, the hotel complex. This is free wheelers which are not related to us. Yes, and Canadian one. Yeah, and Canadian. Yeah, in here a little bit further, we will have exactly the townhouses, different cube wheelers and the whole complex itself. Yeah, we can go there. But the access is pretty far and also the road behind the road. Here road and there will be the road. Oh. Kind actually not because they're only trees and nature there and there are no roads. So, this one is a leasehold? Yeah, this is leasehold in 28 years with prolongation for 25. This hold for 25. First leasehold 28 plus 25. We have already cut a lot of trees because there was like very full territory of mango trees. But anyway, in our location because it's kind of echo resort, we are going to have a lot of greens. Because all defenses will be made by nature, by wooden, by trees itself. And a lot of mango trees are going to be located exactly in our whole territory. Access will be a dozen meter what kind of unit the person is going to use. Like hotel, apartment or villa. They can just walk around the whole complex and use all the things. Spa centers, co-working centers, gym, yeah, only paying for restaurants. Yeah, the only thing. Yeah, the other things will be included. Yeah, it doesn't matter what kind of unit the person comes to. Yeah, exactly here. Before that trees are going to be located, the here exactly is going to be townhouses. There are townhouses in the center site is going to be swimming pools, children playgrounds. We also have this in our master plan. Also walking zones. One interesting and important thing that 50% you know there is a rule in Bali that only 50% of territory can be built with the houses. And we exactly follow this rule. So we have a lot of territory for walk, a lot of territory just to have some entertainment. Yeah, and only 50% will be busy with exactly the buildings. Yeah, now we are in the stage of getting a PBG. Yeah, but we already got another special ID number. I will just tell you the name to be honest. Oh, you should let me. Oh, that's why you name it. Mango village. Yeah, mango village, exactly. And you saw there is the Bulgar hotel just five minutes. Yeah. So quite premium location and the prices are going to be quite high. There we will also go a little bit further to Vilas. Yeah, just one second. Yeah, and Vilas are also cost the cost of for night starts from $500. $500, yeah. Yeah, we have already got PPCPR, the verification of island use. Yeah, and now we are in the process to get PBG because it's quite long process. So about the two or three weeks we are going to get the ID number for PBG and we are ready to start the building because before that it's impossible, according to the rules of Indonesia. Yeah, that's why we now just got the house for future builders. Yeah, building houses and very soon in December we are going to start. And also here we are going to give the prototype of our Vilas because we are going to have a special villa. I don't know, do you know about our concept of 3D printing? Yes, yes. And exactly we are going to put the prototype here to a four like showroom and the people can come and see. Yeah, that's very perfect because people don't know about our construction of 3D printing. It's new for Indonesia. Yeah, it's already built in China, in Japan. Yeah, but here it's going to be new one. So people are very interested what it is exactly. And in the middle of December, yeah, I think before New Year we are going to install exactly the prototype of it. We will inform you anyway if we have future negotiations. Of course we will inform you. Let's go a little further. Do you have a local partner or do you just full DNA? Yes, DNA. Local partners. For an investor, are you 100% for an investor? Yeah, we are 100% investor. Yeah, we have a pretty good investor. Yeah, we have three co-founders. Yeah, the people who are working on building this whole complex, they have shareholders. Shareholders. Yeah. Shareholders. Oh, yes, all forayner. Actually, the company is exactly working in the nation, market more than five years. Yeah, we were working in the consulting sphere. We helped different constructors for marketing and sales before. What company? For a form of consulting. Yeah, it was the marketing sales. It was just the sales. It was the helping in the project, the whole, in the construction, the development, construction helping in the project. Because we worked with forayner companies like Utopia LAP, which is exactly the architecture company. Yes, and they helped to construct the whole thing. Yeah, here, can you show exactly in this place, here, is going to be like the key to our up-part complex. This one? Yeah, you know, this one. But we have Closer Master Plan. Yeah. Here, we turned left. Exactly here, yes, it's going to be like it. Now we're a part complex. It's four floors and a rooftop. Four floors, four apartments and a rooftop. Yeah, no more than 15 meters, according to the legislation. Yeah, so about this thing, everything is correct. And then... This one is stage two. It's a stage two. Exactly. Now we are in presale of stage one. Stage one here. Yes, stage one is there in the center. Okay, okay. Yeah. What is it? This is swimming pools. Oh, also. We have swimming pools for everybody. Even wheelers have, even townhouses have, they are all swimming pools. But it's no problem to use. So where's the villa? The villa is here and the residential here? Mm-hmm. Yeah. You mean like... We now are standing near here, like exactly here. Oh. We are standing and looking and our apart complex, which is going to be located here. Yeah. Yeah. Also... Here. Yeah, apartments in apartment complex have ocean views. Aye. Four floors. Four floors and the rooftop of the floors, we have the ocean view, exactly there. Yeah. Yeah, we can go to the cliff because it's only 100 meters from here and see the view because it's the highest cliff in Oluvato. In Oluvato. Yeah, we can go. And we also... There is a pass to the ocean, but unfortunately, the condition is not good. And we are thinking about a negotiation with the government to, for collaboration, to re-review this one, re-new like it, make it comfortable for people to go down to the ocean. Because the condition is really not bad and it's a little dangerous now. Yeah, but I will show you. I'll show you just... Ah, yeah, we are going to have bus, uh, shuttle bus to the beach. Yeah, most likely it's going to be Nyankyank because it's five, seven minutes from here. Yeah, very cool. So, the design is like Trangong? Yes, it's exactly our Instagram card. Yes, we'll just... This is one of our units, which is called Nacho. Yeah, in the second... ...dittering the whole... Yeah, if you open the second screen, exactly the second in the presentation, if I'm not mistaken, it's going to be exactly... Ah, I can show you. It's typical by phone, but it's... This one, right? This one? Yeah, it's exactly this kind of prototype. We are going to install here. Oh, because Trangong won. Yeah, because only 3D printing contraction is like, it's possible to do this only with unusual form of building. In traditional form, it's almost impossible or very expensive to construct something similar. That's why we have like this new feature in exactly the structure. So, we use BIM. We use... Yeah, BIM. BIM, BIM. Um, we have a building... Building what? Yeah, information management? Building information management. Yes, we are working with... Chinese company, which has... Yeah, our company, big by the group, we have subcompany, which is called Legends 3D. Legends 3D, it's the only company in Indonesia, which can deliver 3D printers from China to here. And we have like special right to use it. For now, only Legends 3D, Legends 3D is our subcompany. Yeah, initially company was... The company, the whole biggest headquarter is in China. Yes, and yesterday we had negotiation, Chinese representative came to our office in Kuta. Yeah, and we had two hours meetings. We talked about the advantages or maybe disadvantages of the 3D printing. He gave us all the certification of standards. He explained us all the information about 3D printing, that this is quite fast way that is used in Dubai. Maybe you know the office of the future. Absolutely. Yeah, it's in Dubai, yes, office of the future. Exactly, was built in the usage of 3D printing. And I will show you also... Why are we talking about power plants? I tell you, it's a 3D, Legends 3D, Autopayla is our Hittaker company, which... Yeah. Our Hittik, the design, but 3D, Legends 3D is exactly... As builder. As builder, yeah. Nice view. Yeah, it's not going in a little bit. The temple is here, exactly, and there's kind of tourists, which is like, if it's very sunny, but we also have a plan to make it a little wider and have a little fence in the cliff. Because it's very nice view here, you will just see. And it's very good for tourists, just to come and... Look at that. Yeah. For example, we can see it's both here. So first. It's just a view of what we can go a little bit further here. And we will see much more interesting view. Very sunny. Yeah. Here. Yeah, yeah. It's over there, a little bit there. The young age there. Yeah. We've not been taken there. Okay. Yeah. But again, in the left side, we have the past, but it's dangerous now. Okay. Not here, it's behind this... Villa. Yeah. So that one is Bulgaria, right? Bulgaria? Yes, they have Villa's there. They have Villa's, but Hotel Complex is a little bit in front of us. Plain here is just to make it as a view platform. Nothing special, maybe it's going to be the fence, because it can be dangerous for children, for example. Yeah, they only think. So this is still your left? No, this is not the left. That's why we are in negotiation process this government for collaboration, because we cannot do this by ourselves. It's prohibited by law. We cannot use the government lens without permission. And because this place doesn't belong to anybody, any company, say any business, so it's governmental one. But this? What? This is the temple, as we know. But all the time when we come here, the temple is... No, it's not. No, it's not. Oh. You think that this is the temple, because there is the temple out there. Oh, the temple? Yeah. But all the time we come here, there's nobody's there. Oh, okay. Is it difficult to say? Yes. And this one is... And this one is the Villa's. Yes. Also, Karyangan. Karyangan. Yeah, I'm just taking just a day or else a premium. Pillows here, when we go back, we can see the names of Pillows. Yeah, the night starts from $5 or $600. So, as an investor, do you think this location is a good... ...interference for us? Yes. I mean, is this the... This location is really the one that... I guess you're setting for or something like that? Absolutely, because this is quite far, you know, from this... ...cars bike's past life. And a lot of people want to come for family relaxing, for example, or just be around the nature. And here it's very quiet. And all the people who come to this Villa's or to Bogor is they exactly search for something like this. And we are exactly between them. You see, it's very quiet. There are no cars here. Absolutely, nobody's driving there. I mean, like... There are no facilities around here, right? I mean, if you want to go... In fact, you have to go like... You know, we thought about that. First of all, we have very big infrastructure in our complex. They are going to be commercial. Properties like in the hotel complex, it's going to be the stores that everything the tourists need to buy. Also the spa centers. We have free restaurants. We have clay ground. A lot of swimming pools opened and closed swimming pools. But if the person, anyway, wants to go to see something, it's only 10 minutes by by here. And there are stores and everything here. And also, a bouquette is very... Like loaded with a lot of beach clubs. A lot of... For example, Milaisteets, it's not so far. Milaisteets. Yankee Yankee is very here. A lot of premium complexes are located exactly in bouquette. Six senses. The age. Yes. So, Savaya Beach Club here. That's why, of course, we are sure that we will have the people who really want for this kind of relaxation. Okay, go to the right. Uh-huh. Hey, you're so straight. How many feet left? A little bit there. Sorry, first stage? Yeah. How many feet left? How many feet left? 20... How many feet left in the first stage? 26? 26. Yes, 26 feet left. And you have already told how many feet? Uh, we... Yeah, we have the... Oh, sorry, I forgot this word in English. So, the person made the prepayment. Free. Yes, free objects. Free objects. Now, we have the very big negotiation with, uh... one potential customer who is exactly an architect. Oh, yeah. And he is exactly... He's a person who wants to know all the kinds of construction, what is happening, what kind of concrete is using. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, uh, our concrete is, uh, the fact is, uh... three times higher standards that Indonesia gives... Yesterday, we, in the collaboration with Chinese person from, uh, Ligens 3D in photocalyzed company, he exactly gave us the list of, uh, standards. Standard, right? Indonesia. Yeah, and we used higher standards than it can be. It's talking about the earthquake sustainable, yes, because we know, because this kind of construction is used in Japan. And in Japan, it's a very big problem. Yeah. Yeah. And how about water here? Water here? What are the conditions? 150 meters. There are... Okay. Uh, they're... sorry me, but I don't remember this word. They're three, you know, like the big holes with 150 meters, uh, deeper. Oh, yeah. They're deep, you dig, you dig the hole. Yeah, with deep water. 150 meters of three holes. Oh. Three, yeah. And, uh, yeah, water is going to... For the whole complex. For the whole complex. Oh, for the whole complex. For the whole complex. Three stages. So the water is... Not an issue? It's not an issue absolutely here. Yeah, we talked about the whole things that the person needs every day, of course. That's the first thing that we thought about. We solved this. That's not a problem here because Bogor is... did the same situation. This is a kind of illness. When, uh, when the uh, the development started? Uh, exactly in December when we get the number of P-D... P-J. It's okay. That's okay. Oh, yeah. P-G. P-G. P-G. P-G. P-G. The number of P-G. P-G. P-G. Okay, P-G. P-G. P-G. P-G. P-G. Oh, we already have 3D printer in Noano. Now it's printing, architectural designer... Yes. The developer is the same with the Noano? No, it just... The printing is... Now it's like the location of our 3D printer. Now it's in Noano. It's working to... Yes, as I know, our 3D printing is also creating the architectural statue or something for Noano. Oh, okay. And we are going to transfer it here to print the prototype that we're told you about. The triangle one. It's not even worth it if we go to Noano. You know, as I know, that's close information because it's kind of new thing. Yeah. But we can make the photo. But we can... Aye, yes. We have the photo in front of us. We have the same front videos for you. Yeah, we can send it because... But on Friday, we print a good video actually. You know, we can ask if it's possible to give this information we would like to share. Yeah, but we are absolutely going to share with you with the videos of printing. Okay. What is happening? Yes. Generally, we can send you the information about 3D printers, how it works and why it's a very good decision now. Yes. I just want to give you a bit of a comment. I'm going to ask you something. I'm going to ask you something. You can't just send it to the camera. All right. Arena just told me that... It's possible to see the Noano object after the end of that. Because even employees who are working in Noano, they have special license to come and see. Yeah, it's like closed information. I don't know because maybe if it's... Everybody can come and see that's not a surprise at heck. Oh, okay. So, do you have any hospitality management? Yeah, first-site management. No, I mean, if we buy some filler and we want to know who are the operator like that. It's first-site management. It's our management company. On your...on the site management. Yeah, it's... Yeah, it's our company. It's a company which is just working in the valley for more than 14 years. Okay. It's one of the top companies, I think you maybe know. It's... Oh, this is called? First-site management. First-site management. First-site management. Yeah. Also... They... I need a presentation. Arena. Hi, Pa. I can a little bit explain about the first-site management. I mean, in the hardware market. In the Indonesian market. Now it's working. It's been working for more than 14 years. Okay. Yes. And under-seyer management, they have more than 500 objects in... Yeah, unfortunately, have this... Hello. Hello. This is our friend. This is our friend. Hello. Nice to meet you. Yeah. They have... You know, they are... This company is collaborating with IRB&D and we think... Oh, in... Yes. Yeah. Okay, the marketing is on IRB&D. Absolutely. The investor doesn't need to do... Actually, anything. And the whole complex will be also served... served by... Our site management, too. And how many percent... If... The investor already had... How many percent out of the whole... Is the... It's more than 50... About 51-52 percent. Yeah, 51-50. So the management is... Management is included. Also, OTA... Like the... The usage of booking can air be in B's... Also included because they pay money for that. Yeah. Yes, also... There is one percent taken for future... Maybe re-innovation if something happens. But we give guarantee 10 years for construction. It's quite big right. Yeah. Yeah. 50-50. Just... 50-50, yeah. Yeah, you know, it doesn't matter what kind of percent... They take... The most important fact is how much the investor finally gets. Yeah, the prices here are not so low because of the location, because of the broker and like that. And... Oh! Yeah, there's a lot more here. How much is taking the ROI? The ROI starts from 15 percent, according to the... For site because for site... Because they work a lot of years in this market. Yeah, they have the... They are... They date a base. And they know the... When the flow of tourists come. So they collaborate the prices in the season when... In the season, exactly when it's season here in Bali. Yeah, so... That's why because of their even experience, it's easy to rely on them. And yes, ROI starts from 15 percent. It depends, of course, on the union. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But it's quite possible for pre-sale price to get all the money back for 5 and 6 years. Because pre-sale price is much lower than the stage one. It's going to be the same stage first. Because we are considered as the premium segment. So the prices are not going to be so low. But in the comparison with the Bulgari, for example, where the wheel is here, we are anyway, our price are much more affordable. But at the same time, the quality. And the unusual construction is here. Yes, that's why. 8.20 percent. Yeah, I heard 10 years. The... The... The... The... Yes. Because it's... We cannot find... Very big, shahai Chinese company, which already made a lot of 3D printing objects. In around the world, Dubai, they are also working in the USA market. Yeah, but the USA have very high standards. Japan market, because first week we can understand that it's sustainable. Yes, so that's why they give the guarantee of that. And we, as a developer, give the guarantee also for 10 years, it's in our agreement. Yes. And one year guarantee for any furniture, like all included, I mean, if something happens in the first year, was it... It's a table, for example, or was it the TV? It's also, there is the guarantee. Full stock guarantee. For construction 10 years. Also... Yeah, actually... There's the biggest buyer here. Sorry? The biggest buyer? The biggest buyer? Yeah, the foreigner. The foreigner. He wants to buy the two bedrooms, apartment with the ocean view. The ocean view? Yeah, the price is more than $250,000, but it's around 80 square meters. Our apartment starts with 48 and the health square meters, one bedroom apartment. That's important because if we go to Chimgur, for example, all the apartments, like one bedroom apartment, start with 20-22 square meters, which is very short. But because we are like the premium segment, we decided to make exactly the peak of our units. So all our units, no of our units, are small. That's the thing. The first floor is only one bedroom, but time for you to... No, we have one bedroom and two bedrooms. And of course, Vila's. One bedroom, Vila, two floors, Vila's with some bedrooms in the rooftop. Yeah, we have around five types of units in the first and second stage, not about the hotel. The hotel is still in the construction. So in the 40s, for sale, I then have like a T-1 and then a bedroom apartment. Apart from that, please. The apartment is level. Yeah, four levels. Four levels, you see? Hotel will be maybe... Yeah, because we cannot build more than 15 meters, according to the station. Yeah, maybe it's going to be five, because it's possible. Yeah. Because... Because the defense actually now the other project managers are working on this project, yes, it's going to be come for information after the new year. Yeah, now exactly, we are talking about the first and second stage. It's Vila's apartment. Apart from that. One bedroom, you know? Thanks, starts from... The price starts with from 134,000. Yeah, it's... It's the smallest, let's say, the smallest, was better, but it's 48 in the house per meter. Yeah, 48. 48. With a pool. You know, we have for apartment complex, we have their Alvin pool in the territory. Only Vila's have their Alvin pool. For the one bedroom Vila, I mean. For one bedroom Vila? Yes, every Vila's. That we have have their Alvin pool. How much does it start? With one bedroom Vila starts, it's exactly natural. This triangle Vila that we just showed, it starts with 215,000 interstates. Or including... Tax. Yes, including the tax. Everything is included. Only maybe... Notary... Notary fees, but... It's usually 1%, we take help of that for us. So the investor needs to pay only help percent. That's all. All the other things are included. 215,000. 1%, notary fee, but you... We pay help of that. Yes. And the investor pays help. The other... All the taxes, the others they are included already in the price. The other taxes are included. So what's the payment term for the one bedroom Vila? Payment term. I mean, we have 30%... 30%? 30% it's the first. The payment and then... We have... Our... I will just... I'll tell you. About 30% you think. Yeah. And then it's possible to pay like every month or every three months before the... We finish the full construction and give to exploitation. It's going to be in September 2026. Works will finish in April, but actually because of the documents for giving to the... Users should that we take a little less than half year. Yes. Around... Around 20 years. Around 20 years. 20 years, yeah. So the balance... 70% it is spread over... 20 years. Yes. Not even 70%, 50%. You can split and finally when we give exactly the keys. And then they can pay 10. And we give 10 for installment for 12 years. And the second investor can pay with the income. Oh, okay. Yeah. It's very interesting. Yeah, that's why we talked about. It's very possible. Of course if investor wants to pay the full or doesn't want to take installment after giving to usage, no problem. Okay. So the one-bedroom villa, 215 thousand US dollars. Yes. How big is that? Meaning in terms of spare meter. 40 feet. 40 feet. 40 feet. It's exactly the first floor. But we have every villa has a big territory, about 190 square meters. The rest included a rooftop. Including... The rooftop included and... The main one is the land size. Yes. I can show you. I can show you. Just sorry, but we couldn't find our English presentation. Yeah, it's easy to find. Oh, you have some vicinity. Yeah. Wow. This is triangle. Yeah. And can I please... That's one-bedroom. Yeah. This is exactly the... Yeah, here you can see that the plot area, it's almost 200 meters. And the unit is 111 because we include tiras and the rooftop. Exactly. And swimming pool is not included, but anyway we have swimming pool to build with meters. So actually, it's not small, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. A little below we have other information. Yes, it's... Can I please show you this one? 3D printing is exactly a print like that. And we are going to save this kind of fall because it's a unique one. We're just going to paint it, of course. Yeah, but the person can see exactly what it is. Yeah. This is one bedroom with rooftop. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Tiras here are big territories and just the green fence around because we are eco-reserve. That's our visit card. Yeah. 150? Yes. In the pre-sale, of course, because we are planning to sell it after the giving to usage, maybe at least 30% more. The price will be at least 30% more, but can be higher. So how much do you demand for that? Demons? Don't payment, I think, at least $60,000. Yeah. And the remaining... We want to split it. $1,000,000 will be like $20,000. And we make it go... Yeah. We actually have the full financial model. Yes, exactly. The detailed financial model. Yeah, I think so. About 8,000 years? Yeah. For 24 months. For 24 months. It's a little less than 24, but yes, around 3,000. Thank you. So what's the... For example, if I took my money down, what's the risk, meaning? There are no risks because we paid for 50% of the whole length and we paid installment in times. So we have the installment that's normal situation, absolutely. And this is almost our length. And also, behind our territory, which is 1.2 hectares, behind where you see the trees, we are also going to buy. And we are in the negotiation process to wipe our projects and make their fifth and sixth stage. Because there is also 1.2, 3, 1.2 hectares of free territory. And our shareholders are in negotiation process of buying this one. The only... This problem. That's not actually a problem, but you can add in guys who didn't agree with Canadian people. Because they wanted to build their real estate here. So this is a different way to put it. This is different. Yes. Over... You put this way in there. Yeah, we are going to be standing here and there. And down there. Yeah. Like there. Yeah, exactly. Behind them, we also have territory. Oh, there's a little around here. Yeah, a little around. Not this one. Yeah, but... This one. This one. Yeah. This one is here. The hotel. The Canadian here. Oh, that one. The triangle. Add the door and the one. Oh, there's a blank screen. Yeah. Oh, you go on onto that side. Yes, yes, there. We have a road here. Here, here, there. Oh, this is the hotel here. This is the hotel here. Yeah. But it's here. The economy up here. The triangle one is here. The perfect. Just in case, the developer cannot be the winner. What's the request of the investor? If developer cannot be the winner. This one, I asked you before, what is your prior project? Because we want to secure our investment right. If we turn, you know your... Yeah, exactly for us. For us, there's a list. Because if the developer cannot be the winner. Oh, yeah. Okay, cannot deliver. You mean the 3D printers? No, no, no. The project is not finished. Yeah, the project is not finished. Okay. Back up. But if the... If the... If the company is not finished, we have to be very careful. Yeah. And we have to be very careful. Yeah. And we have to tail this. Yeah. And... And we have to be very careful. As I told, actually, we have free shareholders. Free, quite big shareholders. And the company is in the Asian market. It's more than five years. That's why the shareholders are exactly... They are free of them because they can support each other in the way of that. There is... You know, I think that's almost impossible to give 100% guarantee. Because the only thing that we can give you, it's the... Maybe bank account to see that we have money. But it's information that nobody can give you. That's why. Yeah. Is it possible for us to teach your office in Kuta? Because... If we can see your office at this, we can... Absolutely. Yeah, we would like to invite you. Yes, that's... In Kuta. In Kuta near Sanctuary, you know? Yeah, very close to Sanctuary. Yeah, we can send you the address. We can agree maybe even today or maybe tomorrow in the morning as much comfortable for you. We have quite big office. The first-site management, which is our management company, is exactly... Make rents, the office in this one. So I've mentioned this in the Malaysian market. It's more than 14 years, so it's also very reliable. Yes, you can easily come to see speak with our heads, with our directors. Yeah, so that's very easy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we'll invest in only one, maybe. Oh, no, no, no. You can come, we can give you all the documents. You have nothing in your... Yeah, as I told you. As I told you, yeah. It's impossible to start giving because we need to get all the documents. And we are in the process. Yes, and... You know, no. There is no problems here because we have already got PPCPR. You have verification of land. Yes, because we bought this land for more than 50% now. And there is a process of giving PPCPR is a little... Not fast. Yeah, but we are ready to get our IDPPCR number, which gives us opportunity to start building. And it's going to be exactly in two, three weeks. So we are talking about the prototype, which we're going to install here of this triangle wheeler. Yes. It's going to be installed in the middle of December. Yes. Somewhere there. So I guess it's going to be somewhere there. Just showroom. Showroom. Yeah. So you will build it by December. Or a prototype. A prototype. Pretty cool. Pretty cool. The predict is very fast way. Yes. Labor. Yeah. One of the very good things. Labor work is excluded here. So if the person is tired, if the person doesn't have enough quality to build, yeah, doesn't matter because the machine with the usage of artificial intelligence knows what to do. And our concrete is very high quality. We also have the document of standards. It's much more higher than in the nation market, ask us for. Yes. So if you put very bad quality of cement, for example, and sand into our machine, it will just not print. So when can we visit it? We will inform you. Of course, we will inform you. We always inform on that. It takes months. Yeah. Exactly. Our director said it's going to be around the middle of December. Yeah. Around the middle of December. Yeah. That's good. The operator is from China. The contractor. Yeah. We have three contractors. Two from China. One, it's a French architecture company, which is going to construct our hotel complex. It's a Nautilus. Maybe you know, they created Hilton. Yeah. And one more. Meridian. Yeah, Meridian. And the use of these. So the name of this complex is Mango. Yes. Our company. It's all mangoes. Mangoes. Oh, yes. Mango. You give free mangoes. Yeah. We are going to have a lot of greens. Yes. Really a lot of greens. Echoes. And even our construction doesn't have a lot of waste because we're printing. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So it's not only looking that we have the green stuff. It's exactly the construction is echo. That's the thing. That's 3D printer. That's 3D printer. There is one thing. 3D printer can be located in any places. But also 3D printing is going to print outside of this place. And some parts, they are delivered here and they can track it. Like mix it. Yeah. We have videos of that. But to be honest, because some people think how is it possible to deliver, maybe it's going to break while delivering? No. We have all the videos how it works. So we will send you today, I think. Yeah. And because only yesterday we had negotiation with Cheney's partner, he came to our office. So he didn't send us all the information, only some presentations. And we will ask him to send the videos that he showed us. And we will send it to you. If you can build it pretty, how come it takes 20 months? For you to do it? Yes. That's a usual question. Because this is anyway the first thing in Bali with the 3D printing, we take just a little time and advance just for hours to guarantee ourselves. Of course it's possible to make it faster. But we don't want to just say that we are going to finish our building here and then in the future we will be surprised. That's the only thing. Because if we deploy our cash, we want our cash to be able to do it. Yes. We just don't want to be a liar. So that's why that's the only thing. So you are not in Euro, right? Yes. Yes. You won't be more expensive. Yes. You will be more expensive. Of course, they can be paid in Rupiah. Rupiah, dollars, swift can be used. A lot of payment methods. Yes. But you are using a local Indonesian company. We are local and the nation company in the nation market more than five years. And the Legends 3D, as I told, they have the special right to build with the printer, 3D printing here. And this is our subcompany. Which is subcompany of. We will talk about which is big Chinese company. It included the other company big by the team. All this information about all the certifications, documents about the territorial police holding, also everything we have, of course, absolutely. We can share this whole. This is the least hold for 28 years plus 25. Plus 25. Let's give it a try. Or you still have to apply later. They can apply even after we give the case. Oh, people that will be applied later, not on the handover. Yes, yes. 28 plus 25. 28 plus 25. Maybe also any question. We can invite you to our office. And you can think about potential questions. Yes, yes. Well, some Indonesian agency also came to our company with talk to them. Yes, so it's not a problem. They are always hoping. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Just the generally we explain the whole situation, which is happening here. How it's going to be working like that. The documents, of course, it's possible to see where required in the office. So I'll check our schedule for tomorrow. Yeah, because our director now is maybe on holiday and maybe he will come back on the Monday. That's the thing when you clarify this question. Yeah, because he's not in the office. Maybe he's not in the office. No, he's not in the office. No, he's not in the office. They are from different countries. Yes. I think not only to the manager. Maybe just the office, the hats, because the hats of marketing and sales. The agency hat is here, but unfortunately my English is a little better. That's why I speak with you. Yeah.
